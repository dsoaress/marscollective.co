# Mars Collective

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f318ebeb-5ac5-4a58-add4-cdb81915f4e9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/marscollective-co/deploys)

We are a collective of great minds and this website is one of our creations.

Developed with the Jamstack architecture, we combined the power of Gatsby (React and GraphQL) with styled-components and Netlify CMS to provide a fast, reliable, and scalable webpage, _served_ by the Netlify CDN. ðŸš€

This project is open source and you're free to fork and remix it to fit your needs, just keep in mind that our blog texts and portfolio items are copyrighted. ðŸ˜‰
