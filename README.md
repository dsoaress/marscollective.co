# Mars Collective

We are a collective of great minds and this website is one of our creations.

Developed with the [Jamstack architecture](https://jamstack.org/), we combined the power of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) to provide a fast, reliable, and scalable webpage, _served_ by the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). ðŸš€

This project is open source and you're free to fork and remix it to fit your needs, just keep in mind that our blog texts and portfolio items are copyrighted. ðŸ˜‰

See it live in action at [marscollective.co](http://marscollective.co) ðŸŒŽ
